# AllezCine

## What is this repository about?

AllezCine is a group project made at Becode. The objective is to create a Web App listing movies and tv series. 
For this, we will on one hand use TheMovieDB API to get informations about the latest trending movies, and on the other hand we will create our own API to keep records of what's on our website as well as like, comments,.. regarding content.
The app will be powered by VueJS, PHP, mySQL.
